BASIC VISUAL ELEMENT - LINE

1. One of the Basic Visual Element of design is the LINE and it should not be underestimated as simple as lines are 
    they can be quite versatile and be used as crucial elements of design 
-- LINES can be STRAIGHT | CURVED | THICK | THIN | SOLID | DASHED 
-- LINES can be used to add structure to a COMPISITION, to FRAME INFORMATION and to DIVIDE INFROMATION 

2.  Used considerately lines can 
    1. add elegance to a composition, 
    2. and hierarchy and 
    3. to draw the eye to a specific point  
-- With Type, LINES can be used to emphasis and put stress on a word a phrase or paragraph  
-- Lines can be used to decorate, Illustrate and Represent Information in Infographics 

3. If we think about Magazines, Newspapers and Maps 
    one of the most common visual elements is the LINE as it works very well to structure information

4. Examples of Line - 
-- Here are some simple horizontal lines, here we have some strokes in various sizes and below some alternatives.
-- A line can be made of more than a single stroke, it can be made with many individual strokes and even dots.

-- So here are some simple examples of how lines may be used in design. 
-- For the sake of simplicity and to focus on the structure 
-- NB: composed the examples in black and white 

-- Example Explain 
-- 1. where line plays a role of building infographics 
--  - this is a simple tree diagram made of lines in different shades
--  - if we zoom into the visual icons they are also lines as illustrations 
--  - so overall a simple visual with another line below as an anchor point for the associated information

-- 2. Next is an example in typography 
--  - here lines are used to divide and draw emphasis to a particular word 

-- 3. Next is an example where lines are used to create a border. 
--  - in this example there are two stroke lines that create this border a thin and a thick
--  - the type of stroke lines you use in relationship to other elements can define a look and feel to your composition
--  - in this case we have a boutique feel
--  - notice here we also have a line that elegantly divides the type

-- 4. so next is an example where lines are used to predominantly structure a composition 
--  - but at the same time decorate. this is a simple chapter index page 
--  - here we have a large dark line running vertically down the page and smaller lines running horizontally across the page 
--  - the horizontal lines are passing through the vertical and inverting in colour as they do so 
       creating a lose grid for the type element to exist
--  - you can see here where the lines are defining and positioning the type elements 

-- 5. next is an example where lines can be used for structure and decorate in a minimal elegant way 
--  - here lines make up the board elements that frame a quote and a line is drawn vertically aligned left crating a base 
       to carry the paragraph next to it 
--  - these lines though in black and white could be used to add a bit of colour onto the page as well as structure 

-- 6. so next is a general example of how lines can divide information 
--  - in newspaper, we can see where lines play a role to divide and decorate information 
--  - at the top we have lines to separate that section from the article section below 
--  - in this section we also have small lines, details used to decorate 
--  - now a line does not necessarily have to be a solid stroke a line can be created by contrast of color or shape on a page 
--  - in the article below we have a big picture. now even though there is no particular stroke applied 
       the solid colour fill to the image creates a line around it 
--  - below this we have the main body of text, in this we have an infographic make with line and lines that break information 
       out such as diagrams, quotes and footers 

-- 7. so the last example shows lines creating decoration, texture and structure on a page 
--  - in this example there are various type of lines going on here 
--  - first we can see the physical line used to create decoration with various stroke effects applied 
--  - in this instance the lines also create another white line through the middle of the page as negative space 
       three columns of type where the third column is breaking alignment to fit in space creating an interesting and dynamic layout
