INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHIC DESIGN

Graphic Design is the art or skill of combining text and pictures in advertisements, magazines, or books 

GRAPHIC :- 
1.. Graphic is Visual Elements, which is associated with Art, Imagination, Expression, involving many mediums 
     such as drawing, painting, engraving or lettering given clear and explicit detail.
2.. So the Graphic part of Graphic Design is made up of visual elements, the building blocks of design 
3.. Through the harness of our artistic expression, we choose these visual elements and arrange them on a surface in a 
     layout to convey an idea 
4.. The BASIC VISUAL ELEMENTS that combine to create Graphic Design include the following - 
     1. LINE | 2. SHAPE | 3. TYPOGRAPHY |
     4. COLOR | 5. TEXTURE | 
     6. SPACE | 7. FORM

DESIGN :- 
1.. To decide upon the look and function of something before it's made.
2.. So the Design is 
     1. THINKING 
     2. PROBLEM SOLVING 
     3. PRACTICALITY - Theory.
    
3.. In Graphic Design there are rules that can be considered. These rules are called the 'DESIGN PRINCIPLES'
4.. These principles all have a relationship between each other and appear in every well designed piece of work you see. 
     So the design principles make the Design in 'Graphic Design'
5.. A good grasp of design theory will mean there is always substance behind your work 
  
6.. KEY PRINCIPLES of DESIGN : 
    1. CONTRAST | 2. HIERARCHY | 3. ALIGNMENT | 
    4. BALANCE | 5. PROXIMITY | 6. REPETITION | 
    7. SIMPLICITY | 8. FUNCTION 

GRAPHIC DESIGN :- 
1.. When we bring both the VISUAL ELEMENTS and the DESIGN PRINCIPLES together we have GRAPHIC DESIGN

2.. Graphic Design is not drawing or painting or creating a poster or a quick logo on your computer 
--  Graphic Design is not about making things look pretty 

3.. Graphic Design is the Organization and Presentation of Information developed through a Creative Process 
     for a Particular Function 
4.. In Graphic Design we must first understand Information, a message or a brief and then research, think, imagine and 
     develop and create a solution, a concept in order to communicate that information, tell a story, a message or idea in 
     a visual way
5.. It's only once we have a solid idea, developed through the 'DESIGN PROCESS' we can use our skills with layout, color, 
     typography and creative tools to bring that idea to life
